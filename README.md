# Alephium

All Alephium wallets should respond to the following JSON-RPC methods which are
received across the WalletConnect connection. There is no method to get
addresses because WalletConnect returns a set of addresses to use when a pairing
is successful or re-establishes. More methods may be added in the future.

## Code as doc for now
